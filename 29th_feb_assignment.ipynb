    "2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Python has strong support for OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism, making it easy to create and work with objects.\n",

    "3. Functional Programming: Python supports functional programming techniques, allowing you to use functions as first-class objects, apply higher-order functions, and leverage features like lambda expressions and list comprehensions.\n",
